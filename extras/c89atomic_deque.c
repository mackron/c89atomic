    NOTE:

    The LÃª et al. paper has an unsigned integer underflow bug in it. Just above we are loading the tail and the
    subtracting 1 from it. When a deque is freshly initialized, most developers will intuitively set the head
    and tail to 0. As a result, the subtraction by 1 will result in the tail underflowing. In the paper, the
    conditional below is done against the unsigned values of the head and tail which will result in the
    algorithm thinking that the deque is filled when it's actually empty.

    I'm going to fix this by casting to a signed integer.
