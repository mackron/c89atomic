I was able to get this compiling with Borland C++ 5.02, but only through the command line. When
compiling from the IDE I get an "Out of hash space" error.

You will need to install Turbo Assembler 5.0 (TASM). To do this, just download the ZIP archive
from here:

    https://github.com/qb40/tasm/releases/tag/1.0.0
    
Then just unzip that somewhere and add the "BIN" folder to your path environment variable.

Borland C++ doesn't handle relative include paths like other compilers. It tries loading files
relative to the current working directory rather than relative to the current file. To work around
this you need to use the "-I" compiler switch. See build.bat in this directory for an example.

The build.bat file can be used to make it easy to compile the test program and to also act as a
reference. To use it, change into this directory and run it.

PSA: If you're curious about playing with Borland C++ 5.02, be aware that for me the installer
decided to just clear out my PATH environment variable. That's fun. Take a copy of your PATH if you
decide to run the installer.
